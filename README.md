# Stack-the-Cubes
My first game using many features and tasks for completion.

- Basic player movement through NavMeshAgent.
- Control of animations and characters obtained from Mixamo with ability to run forward.
- Ability to collect coins, which are maintained with object pooling.
- Curtains change coin states, shown as colour, which represent the final points.
- Coins create a pile of cubes behind the player.
- The cube tower are removed at the end, giving points based on the colour of the cube.
- 8 chapters with a difficulty setting, character running faster as it goes.
- Using object pooling to limit the quantities of coins to be spawned.
- Moving objects as a group by moving a parent through code.

Enjoy!
